Rooster is a multifunction discord bot tailored specifically for eve-online corporations.

# Running

It preferrable that you invite my hosted version of rooster to your server with the !invite link, however if you must run your own local bot:

Python 3.5 or higher is required

Copy config.py.example to config.py, edit appropriately.

create a pyvenv using `python3.6 -m venv /path/to/venv/`

activate your venv `source /path/to/venve/bin/activate`

install requirements based in requirements.txt to your venv `pip install -r requirements.txt`

then simply run `python launcher.py` and enjoy.

Rooster is made with love for Fweddit and friends by Chainsaw McGinny.

Special thanks to Sergei Alexeyev for a baller api at fweddit.space (previously evehound) and for constant bugfixing and stress testing.
